The Tree of Life (Etz Chaim) is one of the most fundamental and important symbols in Kabbalah. It represents the process of Creation and the relationship between the Divine and all levels of existence. The Tree consists of ten Sephiroth (singular: Sephirah) connected by twenty-two paths.

The Ten Sephiroth:

1. Kether (Crown) - The highest and most abstract of the Sephiroth, representing pure divine consciousness
2. Chokmah (Wisdom) - The first manifestation of divine will, representing the father principle
3. Binah (Understanding) - Divine understanding and the mother principle
4. Chesed (Mercy) - Loving-kindness and expansion
5. Geburah (Severity) - Judgment and contraction
6. Tiphereth (Beauty) - Harmony and balance
7. Netzach (Victory) - Emotion and natural instinct
8. Hod (Splendor) - Intellect and form
9. Yesod (Foundation) - The astral plane and connection between higher and lower
10. Malkuth (Kingdom) - The physical world and divine presence in matter

The Three Pillars:
- Right Pillar (Mercy): Chokmah, Chesed, Netzach
- Middle Pillar (Balance): Kether, Tiphereth, Yesod, Malkuth
- Left Pillar (Severity): Binah, Geburah, Hod

The Four Worlds:
1. Atziluth - World of Emanation
2. Briah - World of Creation
3. Yetzirah - World of Formation
4. Assiah - World of Action

Each path between the Sephiroth corresponds to a Hebrew letter and represents a specific type of spiritual work or transformation. The Tree serves as both a map of creation and a practical guide for spiritual development.

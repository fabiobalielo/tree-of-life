Personalization Guide for Tree of Life Visualizations

1. General Guidelines for Personalizing the Tree

When creating a personalized Tree of Life for an individual, consider these key principles:

- Respect the traditional structure (positions of Sephiroth remain fixed)
- Customize colors, intensities, and descriptions to reflect personal situations
- Focus on current energies, challenges, and aspirations
- Create path connections that illustrate the individual's unique journey
- Use metaphors that resonate with the person's cultural and spiritual background

2. Analyzing User Conversations

To create a relevant Tree of Life, analyze these aspects of user conversations:

5. Connecting to Traditional Kabbalah

Always remember that personalized Trees should maintain connections to traditional Kabbalistic wisdom:

- Reference traditional correspondences when relevant
- Explain how personal experience maps to universal principles
- Draw from the wisdom of the four worlds and three pillars
- Relate personal paths to the 22 Hebrew letters when appropriate

6. Evolution Through Conversation

The Tree of Life visualization should evolve as the conversation deepens:

- Update colors and intensities based on new insights
- Add or highlight paths as connections become apparent
- Refine descriptions to reflect deeper understanding
- Allow for progressive revelation of more complex aspects

7. Sacred Geometry Principles

The proportions of the Tree contain sacred geometry that can be highlighted:

- The three triangles represent different aspects of being
- The middle pillar represents balance
- The tree contains both opposing forces and their resolution
- The overall structure moves from unity (top) to multiplicity (bottom)

When personalizing, respect these geometric principles while adapting the visual elements to reflect the individual's unique journey through the mystical structure of existence.
